        description: `Your tank’s water temperature should 
        be comfortable enough to sustain aquatic life. 
        Any major changes to your tank’s temperature can 
        be fatal to your fish. Avoid placing your tank in 
        an area that receives a lot of sunlight or near 
        cooling vents. Freshwater fish need a constant 
        water temperature between 72°F – 82°F; 
        saltwater fish thrive between 75°F – 80°F. 
        Temperature levels also depends on each fish 
        species so it’s important to research for the 
        best possible results. You may need to buy a 
        water heater for your tank if your aquarium 
        is too cool to maintain your fish.`

        title: "Avoid overfeeding your fish",
        description: `This one is a cardinal rule in 
        maintaining an aquarium. Overfeeding your fish 
        can cause a variety of problems, including increasing 
        the amount of waste and debris in your tank. Most 
        fish do not need to be fed a huge amount of food to 
        survive. Overfeeding can also encourage algae growth, 
        further depleting your water quality and oxygen. 
        Maintain a consistent feeding schedule and provide 
        an appropriate amount of food.`

        title: "Acclimate your fish to the water",
        description: `Acclimation is an essential part of 
        introducing your fish to their new home. Many fish 
        species are delicate and thus, without proper 
        acclimation, they may go through shock. You can 
        ask our Pet counselors on the best acclimation 
        methods for your pet fish. They may advise you 
        to test the water chemistry before you begin the 
        process. Once you arrive home, make sure to test 
        the water based on the appropriate chemical levels. 
        If your tank levels differ, you will need to 
        acclimate your fish a little longer.`
